Personal dotfiles of my hyprland setup.

## How do I install ts
### Prerequisites
 - You have everything listed in REQ.txt to be installed beforehand.

> **NOTE**: These commands will rename `hypr` to `hypr_backup` in case you would like to switch if you didn't like my configs :(
```
mv ~/.config/hypr ~/.config/hypr_backup
git clone https://github.com/j3h1/dot-hypr ~/.config/hypr
```
